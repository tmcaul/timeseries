# timeseries
Some example analysess for predicting future trends using autoregressive and ML models 

Included here:

- An ARIMA model (implemented from https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-guide-to-time-series-forecasting-with-arima-in-python-3)

- An LSTM model, implemeted in TensorFlow (inspired by https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-lstm-models-for-time-series-forecasting/ and the TensorFlow tutorial docs)

- A sequence-to-sequence transformer network, implemented in PyTorch (inspired by "Attention is all you need", "BERT", and using multiheaded attention code implemented at https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/en/week12/12-3/ and the TensorFlow wiki).
