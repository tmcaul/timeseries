# timeseries
Some example analysis for predicting future trends using autoregressive models 

Included here:
An ARIMA model (implemented from https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-guide-to-time-series-forecasting-with-arima-in-python-3)
An LSTM model, implemeted in TensorFlow (inspired by https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-lstm-models-for-time-series-forecasting/ and the TensorFlow tutorial docs0
)
